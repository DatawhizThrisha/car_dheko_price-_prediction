# Car Dekho Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the price of cars using a dataset named `result`. The prediction is based on various features like car specifications, age, mileage, fuel type, etc. By utilizing machine learning techniques, the model aims to provide accurate price predictions for used cars, helping users make informed decisions.

## Features
- Predicts car prices based on user-provided inputs.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions.
- User-friendly interface for input and result display.

## Dataset
### Name: `result`
The dataset contains information about:
- **Car Name**: The brand and model of the car.
- **Year**: Manufacturing year of the car.
- **Mileage**: Distance the car has traveled.
- **Fuel Type**: Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.
- **Transmission**: Automatic or Manual.
- **Owner**: Number of previous owners.
- **Selling Price**: Price at which the car was sold (target variable).

Ensure the dataset is in `.csv` format and is pre-processed before use.

## Installation and Requirements
### Prerequisites:
- Python (3.8 or higher)
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, `flask` (for deployment)

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd car_dheko_price_prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Add the `result.csv` dataset to the project directory.

## Usage
### Data Preprocessing:
1. Load the dataset:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv('result.csv')
   ```
2. Handle missing values, if any.
3. Perform feature engineering and scaling.

### Model Training:
1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets:
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   X = df.drop('Selling Price', axis=1)
   y = df['Selling Price']
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```
2. Train the model using algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.

### Prediction:
Use the trained model to predict car prices based on new data inputs.

## Future Work
- Integrate advanced ML models for better accuracy.
- Deploy the model on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.
- Add a recommendation system for similar cars.
